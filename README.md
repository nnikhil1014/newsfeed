## About The Project

This is a simple and interactive news web app where users can browse trending articles, read the short descriptions, and click to view full articles. It fetches data from an external API (NewsAPI) and displays it in a clean and modern interface built with React and Tailwind CSS. This project is perfect for practicing React, react-router, and API integration concepts.
